## Answer people's questions

Below are some guidelines about answering questions. These are not hard-bound rules that must be followed because every situation is different and require judgement, and I trust your judgement, which is why you were invited to become a maintainer.

### Simple questions

A simple, easy question you know the answer to and is a short answer can be answered directly.

### Compose design questions

It is a good idea to answer people's questions related to the design of Compose by directing them with a quote and/or link to the part of the README or CONTRIBUTING file that answers their question or is related to their question.

If there is no such documentation to point them to and their question is a sensible question, then fantastic, a gap in the documentation has been found and an issue should be created to address this so this documentation is created.

## Review and merge pull requests

This is something I really need help with. It is a bottleneck for the project unless we have enough people doing this. Fortunately this is fun work.

Only work on pull requests that you want to work on. If you don't feel you should handle a particular pull request for some reason, don't work on it. If you only want to review a pull request and give feedback on it, but not merge it, that's great. Do what you feel is right for yourself and the project. 

Assign to yourself a pull request that you are reviewing so others know it is being reviewed. More than one person or maintainer can review the same pull request at the same time. Depending on the pull request, and the context, it can be beneficial that more than one maintainer reviews it.

Before merging a pull request look at all the data concerning the pull request. Look at the code in the pull request and see if it makes sense.

Every pull request is different and so use your judgement about what should be done about each individual pull request.

Be really nice to people who submit pull requests even if there are a lot of problems with what they submit. But never merge a pull request because you are being nice. If there is something wrong, give feedback about it politely.

I extremely appreciate people who submit a pull request because they want to help our project.

**As maintainers we are responsible for the quality of Compose.**

## Maintain communication about the project

Share with people what is going on. It is great to highlight other's work in our project.

Join the private discord channel for maintainers.

We probably need to come up with some procedures for maintainers so we can coordinate better.

This MAINTAINERS file should evolve as we learn and determine efficient ways to do and handle more things. Discussion and pull requests on this file are welcome.
